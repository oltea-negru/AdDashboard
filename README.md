# AdDashboard is a tool for online marketing agencies.
Created while working in a team with 4 other students as part of my Software Engineering Group Project.

The application analyzes high-scale data and displays key metrics about one or multiple campaigns on a user-friendly dashboard,
as well as graphs of performance over time and within particular audience contexts.
